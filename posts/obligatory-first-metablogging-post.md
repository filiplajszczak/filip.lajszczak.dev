I started that blog with [one
post](test-driven-development-with-python-revisited.html) that I have written
some time ago, and it just required some finishing touches. As it was lonely, it
required a companion. What is the easiest subject to blog about? Blogging! So
here is the blog post about how that blog was made and deployed.

The place was needed to publish both of my blogposts. The one you are reading
now, and the original one that was the reason to start the blog. Experienced
bloggers [advise programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxP9HD1Dq-w) to
reduce technical side of blogging to minimum, and use some out of the box
solution. That way it could happen faster or happen at all. It sounds like a
good idea, but I'm not following it.
