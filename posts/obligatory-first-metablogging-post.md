What is that blog?

It responds to the vital needs of the entire society. This is a blog on the
scale of our capabilities. Do you know what
we are doing with this blog? We are opening the eyes of skeptics. Look, we say,
this is ours, done by us, and this is not our last word!

Are we serious?

Not really. I'm just
paraphrasing [some movie dialogue](https://pl.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mi%C5%9B#Dialogi).

So, why did we need that blog?

I had [one
post](test-driven-development-with-python-revisited.html) that was written some
time ago, and it just required some
finishing touches. As it was lonely, it
required a companion.

What is the easiest subject to blog about?

Blogging! So here is the blog post about how that blog was made and deployed.

The place was needed to publish both of our blogposts. That one, and the
original one that was the reason to start the
blog.

Experienced bloggers [advise
programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxP9HD1Dq-w) to
reduce technical side of
blogging to minimum, and use some out of the box solution. That way it could
happen faster or happen at all.

It sounds like a good idea...

...but I am not following that path.

If not something easy, then what?

We are using [Haunt](https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html) static site
generator written
by [Dave Thompson](https://dthompson.us/)
in [Guile Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/).

So, did we have to learn Guile Scheme?

Yes, I always wanted to learn Scheme better, and this was a good opportunity.
I'm not an expert, but after solving [some Advent of Code
problems](https://git.sr.ht/~filiplajszczak/advent-of-code-2022)
and [porting](https://gitlab.com/filiplajszczak/guile-algorithms) [Conor 
Hoekstraâ€™s](https://github.com/codereport) [racket-algorithms](https://docs.racket-lang.org/algorithms/index.html)
to Guile, I'm not afraid of it anymore.

Is that blog the first page we deployed with Haunt?

No, I have [Awesome Haunt Page](https://awesome.haunt.page/) as a sandbox and
testing ground.

Was it helpful?

Very much so. I was able to collect examples rendered by Haunt, and then use
them as a reference to render that collection of examples. Thanks to the
examples themselves.

It sounds very meta.

That was the
idea. [Metacircualarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-circular_evaluator)
is very lispy.

It looks like it took some time to deploy that blog. Awesome Haunt Page was
published in 2021, and now it is 2023.

Maybe experienced bloggers were right, and it would be faster to use some ready
solution, but would it be as much fun?

Why is the form of that blog so weird?

It is based on the style of the Little books like [The Little
Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262560993/the-little-schemer/)
that I like very much.

Was it always planned to be like that?

No, originally it was supposed to be a normal blog, but then I read Peter
Norvig's foreword to [The Little Learner](https://www.thelittlelearner.com/),
and I was inspired to try something
different.

Where is it hosted? How is it deployed? How is it built? What about the code
that produces that awkwardly looking blog posts?

I will need to dedicate a separate post to that. It is a long story.

You know how it sounds, right?

We know, my precious. We know.
